**Introduction**

This code demonstrates the basics of strings in Python, including how to create strings, concatenate strings, and check the type of a string.

**Creating Strings**

Strings are created by enclosing a sequence of characters in single or double quotes. For example, the following code creates a string containing the text "this is harsha vardhan":

```python
str1 = 'this is harsha vardhan'
```

**Concatenating Strings**

Strings can be concatenated using the + operator. For example, the following code concatenates the strings str1 and str2:

```python
str1 = 'this is harsha vardhan'
str2 = 'i am a developer'
str3 = str1 + str2
```

The resulting string str3 will contain the text "this is harsha vardhan i am a developer".

**Checking the Type of a String**

The type of a variable can be checked using the type() function. For example, the following code checks the type of the string str1:

```python
str1 = 'this is harsha vardhan'
print(type(str1))
```

The output of this code will be:

```
<class 'str'>
```

This indicates that str1 is a string.

**Conclusion**

This code demonstrates the basics of strings in Python, including how to create strings, concatenate strings, and check the type of a string.
