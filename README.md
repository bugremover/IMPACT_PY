## Introduction

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## Installation

To start coding in Python, you first need to install it on your system. Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version suitable for your operating system.

## Running Python Code

After installation, you can run Python code using the command line or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Create a Python file with a `.py` extension and execute it using the `python filename.py` command.

## Python Syntax

Python uses indentation to define code blocks, making it visually clear and concise. Avoid using tabs and stick to spaces to maintain consistency.

```python
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
else:
    print("Non-positive")
```

## Variables and Data Types

Variables store data, and Python has various data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, and dictionaries.

```python
age = 25
height = 1.75
name = "John"
is_student = True
```

## Control Flow

Control flow structures, such as `if`, `elif`, and `else`, control the execution of code based on conditions.

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is true
elif another_condition:
    # Code to execute if the first condition is false and this condition is true
else:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are false
```

## Functions

Functions allow you to encapsulate code for reuse. They are defined using the `def` keyword.

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

## Lists

Lists are ordered, mutable sequences, and they can contain elements of different data types.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
```

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries store key-value pairs, allowing efficient data retrieval.

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "is_student": False}
```

## Loops

Loops, such as `for` and `while`, help iterate over sequences or execute code repeatedly.

```python
for item in iterable:
    # Code to execute for each item in the iterable

while condition:
    # Code to execute while the condition is true
```

## File Handling

Python provides functions for reading from and writing to files.

```python
with open("filename.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()

with open("newfile.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
```

## Exception Handling

Use `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except SomeException as e:
    # Code to handle the exception
else:
    # Code to execute if no exception occurs
finally:
    # Code to execute regardless of whether an exception occurred
```

## Modules and Libraries

Python has a rich ecosystem of modules and libraries that extend its functionality. You can import and use them in your code.

```python
import math

result = math.sqrt(25)
```
# Python Math Basics

Welcome to the Python Math Basics README! This document covers the fundamental mathematical operations and concepts in Python, providing a handy reference for solving common mathematical problems.

## Table of Contents
1. [Arithmetic Operations](#arithmetic-operations)
2. [Variables and Expressions](#variables-and-expressions)
3. [Math Functions](#math-functions)
4. [Random Numbers](#random-numbers)

## Arithmetic Operations

Python supports the basic arithmetic operations:

```python
# Addition
result_add = 3 + 4

# Subtraction
result_sub = 7 - 2

# Multiplication
result_mul = 5 * 6

# Division
result_div = 8 / 2

# Integer Division
result_int_div = 8 // 3

# Modulus (Remainder)
result_mod = 10 % 3

# Exponentiation
result_exp = 2 ** 4
```

## Variables and Expressions

Variables can store numerical values, and expressions combine variables and operators:

```python
x = 5
y = 3

# Expressions
sum_result = x + y
product_result = x * y
```

## Math Functions

Python provides a `math` module with various mathematical functions:

```python
import math

# Square root
sqrt_result = math.sqrt(16)

# Trigonometric functions
sin_result = math.sin(math.radians(30))
cos_result = math.cos(math.radians(60))

# Logarithm
log_result = math.log(100, 10)

# Absolute value
abs_result = abs(-7)
```

## Random Numbers

To work with random numbers, use the `random` module:

```python
import random

# Random float in [0.0, 1.0)
random_float = random.random()

# Random integer in a range
random_int = random.randint(1, 10)

# Random choice from a sequence
choices = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
random_choice = random.choice(choices)
```
